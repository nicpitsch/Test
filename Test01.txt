I continue editing it on the TestFeature1 branch now 201601150721. Means after editing it on the master branch and without merging before.

Possible way to solve the problem
To honest, in the retrospective it isn't anymore comprehensible what lend to the solution :-(. And yes, is this problem really solved?

What I did:

	* Drop content of the Visual Studio (VS) ShadowCache folder. ( I also was more rigide and did delete the full 11.0/14.0 folder, but that does also damage the Extension settings. I had also the reinstall ReSharper. )
	* Uninstall Blend for Visual Studio from the VS Setup (Systemsteuerung.. Programme und Funktionen) and reinstall it(?).
	* Set Target Framework of the VS Projects to .NET Frameworkt 4.6.1.


So now, when I start ProjAdmin, the XAML Designer window of the View may display an error message or a part or all of the Telerik controls aren't rendered.
What to do:

	* Kill the XDescProc.exe Process within the Windows Task-Manager.
	* Rebuild that Project within VS.
	* Start the reload the designer command within the View window.

I should get a warning when try to checkout another branch?!
