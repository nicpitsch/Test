Possible way to solve the problem
To honest, in the retrospective it isn't anymore comprehensible what lend to the solution :-(. And yes, is this problem really solved?

What I did:

	* Drop content of the Visual Studio (VS) ShadowCache folder. ( I also was more rigide and did delete the full 11.0/14.0 folder, but that does also damage the Extension settings. I had also the reinstall ReSharper. )
	* Uninstall Blend for Visual Studio from the VS Setup (Systemsteuerung.. Programme und Funktionen) and reinstall it(?).
	* Set Target Framework of the VS Projects to .NET Frameworkt 4.6.1.


So now, when I start ProjAdmin, the XAML Designer window of the View may display an error message or a part or all of the Telerik controls aren't rendered.
What to do:

I do now 201601150720 edit and commit it on the master branch.
